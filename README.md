# About

üçùüçùüçùüçùüçùüçùüçù

Although this is a game and running the repo locally will launch a game, the aim of this project is not to build a game. This repo is a little area to hack around and learn about the fundamentals of game engine development. The code herein is poorly written, filled with tech debt, and repetitive. There are no state machines or ECS to save you, just one eslint config and the occasional jsdoc comment.

This project will be sufficiently complete when it is abandoned for a new project that bears any semblance of forethought.

# Technology

- **Webpack** for bundling JavaScript and css files
- **Three.js**  for rendering 3d assets
- **Web Workers** for delegating tasks to separate threads

# Requirements and Running Locally

**Requirements**:

- A modern browser that supports webl
- Node version 12.*.* or greater. Early version may work but are not explicitly supported


**Running Locally**
Open your terminal and enter,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LudwigThePig/Ludwig-s-Game.git
cd Ludwig-s-Game
npm install
npm start
```
# Features

## Game Features

You can move Ludwig around and hit some blocks.

## Engine Features

**Collision Detection**

Currently, the engine is setup to detect collision between rigid bodies. To apply collision detection to a mesh, use the `applyRigidBody` method. It will extract the bounding verticies and push them onto the rigidBodies array, which is then checked at render time.

**Player Movement**

Player movement is pretty simple right now. You can move forward, backwards, and rotate.

**Physics**

If the pig hits a box, it goes flying up! Not much more than that at the moment
